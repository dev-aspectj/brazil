This repository contains a fork of **brazil**, an extremely small footprint HTTP stack and flexible architecture for adding URL-based interfaces to arbitrary applications and devices from Sun Labs.

The source snapshot this fork is based formed the release of version 2.3 of **brazil** and was fetched from the now defunct [Sun Research](http://research.sun.com/brazil/) website in December, 2007. The site may still be seen at the [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20090304142142/http://research.sun.com/brazil) but the downloads do not appear to be preserved.
