This directory contains the Brazil project sources.

Notes:
- These files are automatically generated by our export scripts.  They
  are modified from the workspace versions in that (1) new copyright notices
  are added to the top of each source file and (2) the files are shuffled to
  insure the directory structure matches the package structure.

- To build the class files from the sources:
  1) make sure all the external jar files (see that java documentation
     for a list) are in the classpath
  2) run either "make" or "ant" depending on which you prefer

- Starting with this release (2.1) the Brazil system can no longer be
  built using a JDK1.1 compiler, JDK1.2 (or higher) is required.  The
  system continues to run with JDK1.1 vm's however, unless otherwise
  restricted by one of the optional external extensions.

- The file "checksums" contains the md5 checksums of each of the files
  as we created them.
