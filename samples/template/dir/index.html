<title>A page in a subdirectory</title>
<p>
The sample template adds an automatic "breadcrumb" bar.
If the site is partitioned into directories, you get a heading
for each sub-directory.
<p>
Notice the <b>dir</b> entry on the navigation bar, which
appears for every page in this directory, and links to
<i>this</i> (the index) page.
