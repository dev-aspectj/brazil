# - If inserted in front of "content.file", proxied content takes 
#   precedence over local content.  In this case, when the proxy
#   is "turned of", we get the local content instead.
# - If inserted after "content.file", local contend takes precident
#   over proxied content.  This allows us to make "local" modifications
#   to remote sites.
