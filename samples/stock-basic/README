Sample application for fetching stock quotes and
computing portfolio values.
This is a variation of the demo in ../stock that uses basic authentication
instead of cookies for session information.
In addition to the capabilities outlined in ../stock.README, 
this example demonstrates:
- dynamic management of basic authentication information
- inline "scripting" to calculate basic authentication tokens
- url mapping, so project may share the same files with different names.

Run with:
java \
   -classpath brazil.jar:tcl.jar \
   sunlabs.brazil.server.Main -c config -c config.stock $*
