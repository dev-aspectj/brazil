<h1><get system.name>, the Asterisk Meetme Conference Manager</h1>
<p>
This is the development site for <get system.name>, 
an AJAX/Comet interface to the
Asterisk system, that provides a
web interface to <code>meetme</code> audio conferences.  It's still under
development, but feel free to try it out and send me comments <a
href=mailto:suhler@sun.com>stephen.uhler@sun.com</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href=login.html>Enter Conference System</a>
<li><a href=/admin/>Administrator access</a>
</ul>
<h2>GUI instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The site's major functions are selectable by clicking the tabs on the left of the browser window.
Tabs whose functions are not relevent (e.g. the <b>login</b> tab when you are already logged-in
are not displayed).
<dl>
<dt><b>home</b>
<dd>This page
<dt><b>signup</b>
<dd>This is used to create a screen name.  You must have a screen name before
    you can log in.
<dt><b>login</b>
<dd>Use to log-in to the system.
    If you forgot your password, enter your screen name leaving the password
    field blank, and click "login".  Then use the "email hint" link
<dt><b>manage</b>
<dd>This is for creating, editting or deleting your conferences.
<dt><b>select</b>
<dd>Use this to select a conference for viewing or monitoring. Only existing conferences may be
    selected. use <b>manage</b> if you wish to create a new one
<ul>
<li>click on a conferencees caller-id to change their caller-id information, 
    icon, or to send them a private message (whisper).
<li>If you are a conference administrator, you will see additional "control"
icons.
</ul>
<dt><b>preferences</b>
<dd>Manage your "address book".  Your address book contains the caller-id
    information for anyone who has joined a conference you have monitored.
    You can use the <b>save</b> button to preserve the entries in your 
    address book.
<dt><b>logout</b>
<dd>Stop using the system.
</dl>
<li>for most things, if you rest the mouse cursor over a "thing", a tool-tip will pop up.

</ul>
<h2>Here are some random notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>It only works with firefox/mozilla (firefox 1.0.6 or newer)
    Firefox 1.0.6 was released on 19July05, so even that is a pretty
    old version.
<li>It requires browser cookies
<li>Each browser window or tab acts like a separate user, with a 
separate set of credentials.
<li>The accounts are persistent, so even when the server crashes or
I restart it, your account should remain
<li>There is lots of debugging output, which slows it down alot
<li>When the web system crashes, it doesn't affect the conference in any way.
<li>Firefox appears to limit the number of simultaneous background (e.g. AJAX) fetches
to two.  If you are logged in as different users on different windows, your response
might be slow.
